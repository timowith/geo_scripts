# Feb 14h, 2022: Little script to scrape WTI oil price off of marketwatch.com.
# Note that the script only works properly during regular trading hours (roughly 10am to 4pm CST)

import requests 
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
# import re

URL = "https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/crude%20oil%20-%20electronic"
page = requests.get(URL)

soup = BeautifulSoup(page.content, "html.parser")

results = soup.find(id = "maincontent")

# Print out the above results as a "prettify" object: 
# print(results.prettify())

text_results = (results.prettify())

# Now that we have the raw HTML GET command as a text based string, 
# we can use the "regex" library 're' to get the substring match for the price
# of oil by searching for two substrings that we know the price will be between. 

# # # --- Trying a different methodology that's native to the bs4 library:
value_matches = results.find_all("div", class_ = "intraday__data")
    
for value_match in value_matches:
    wti_quote = value_match.find("bg-quote")
    #print(wti_quote.text)
    wti_price = str(wti_quote.text)
    
value_matches = results.find_all("div", class_ = "intraday__timestamp")
    
# Now find the timestamp: 
for value_match in value_matches:
    wti_time = value_match.find("span", class_='timestamp__time')
    #print(wti_time.text)
    wti_time = str(wti_time.text)

# Cut out the superfluous parts of the date string:
wti_time_cut = wti_time[14:len(wti_time)]
# Now, make the final combo string that we will paste out in the command line of Spyder: 
Combo_String = 'The price of WTI is ' + wti_price + ', as of ' + wti_time_cut
print(Combo_String)
